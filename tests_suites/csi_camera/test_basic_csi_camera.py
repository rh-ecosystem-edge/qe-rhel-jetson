CSI camera tests for Jetson RPMs.

Known Issues
============

1. MIPI/CSI2 Camera Modules Blacklisted (RHEL 9)
   Issue: Camera kernel modules (tegra_camera, tegra_camera_platform, tegra_camera_rtcpu)
          are blacklisted in kmod RPM's nvidia-camera.conf. The camera RPM is
          ready, but MIPI/CSI2 requires kernel patches not available in RHEL 9.
   References: RHEL-56474, RHELBU-2601
   Developer: Nirmala Dalvi — investigating whether RHEL 9.8 has the patches,
              testing Allied Vision MIPI cameras on 9.7/9.8 nightly.
   Contact: hgeaydem — confirmed MIPI/CSI2 is NOT a GA feature for RHEL 9.
            Most customers use USB/network cameras (no kmods needed).
   Affected tests: test_csi_camera_devices, test_csi_camera_sysfs,
                    test_camera_driver_loaded
   Fix applied: assert -> warnings.warn() so tests pass on both RPM-only
                and bootc setups.
   TODO: If RHEL 9.7/9.8+ gets patches — unblacklist modules, convert back to asserts.
         For RHEL 10+ — convert to asserts (patches confirmed in RHEL-56474).
