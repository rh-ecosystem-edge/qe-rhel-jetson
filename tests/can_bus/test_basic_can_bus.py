        Test CAN bus loopback:
        You can perform a loopback test to determine whether the controller is working.

        since we don't have a physical transceiver on the board, we can't test the full CAN bus connection.
        CAN controller (on SOC) <--> Transceiver (on Board) <--> device (via external interface - eg USB etc)
        The loopback test is a simple way to test the CAN bus connection without the transceiver, 
        which test only the CAN controller (which is part of Jetson SoC).
